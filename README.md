# DABC HW Week 17  Leaflet / Geojson challenge
## Project Repo: leaflet-challenge

### Part 1:  Leaflet-Step-1  Basic Visualization
+ 1. USGS Earthquake dataset sourced from:  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

+ 2. Import & Visualize Data

++ Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

++ Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

++ Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

++ Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.


### Part 2:  Leaflet-Step-2 More Data (optional)
+1. Tectonic plate dataset sourced from: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates
+2.  Instructions: 
++Plot a second data set on our map.
++Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
++Add layer controls to our map.
