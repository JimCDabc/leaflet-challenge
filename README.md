# DABC HW Week 17  Leaflet / Geojson challenge
## Project Repo: leaflet-challenge

### Part 1:  Leaflet-Step-1  Basic Visualization
1. USGS Earthquake dataset sourced from:  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

2. Import & Visualize Data
  * Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.
  * Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.
  * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
  * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.


### Part 2:  Leaflet-Step-2 More Data (optional)
 1. Tectonic plate dataset sourced from: https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates

 2.  Instructions: 

  * Plot a second data set on our map.
  * Add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
  * Add layer controls to our map.
